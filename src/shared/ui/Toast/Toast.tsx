/**
 * "Saved", said once and then gone.
 *
 * Until this existed a save said nothing at all: the row stopped showing its buttons and that
 * was the whole confirmation. On a screen where the save button only appears when something
 * has changed, the button disappearing is also what a failure looks like.
 *
 * **Success only, by convention.** An error stays on the screen in a `Callout`, because the
 * person has to read it while they fix the thing it is about, and a message that removes itself
 * after four seconds is the wrong shape for that. The danger tone here is for a failure with
 * nowhere else to go — an action fired from a row, with no form to attach a message to.
 *
 * Radix owns the behaviour: a toast is a live region, it pauses on hover and on focus, swipe
 * and Escape dismiss it, and the viewport is reachable by keyboard. None of that is worth
 * reimplementing, and all of it is wrong when it is.
