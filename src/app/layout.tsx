/**
 * Inter, and no request ever leaves the browser to fetch it.
 *
 * `next/font/google` reads Google's font files **at build time**, copies them into the
 * application's own static output and emits a `@font-face` pointing at our origin. Nothing in
 * the rendered page mentions Google, so a visitor's IP address never reaches it — which is why
 * `docs/design-system.md` bans the CDN.
 *
 * What it does cost: the build needs to reach Google once, and the font files are not in the
 * repository. For an air-gapped or fully repeatable build, commit the files and switch to
 * `next/font/local`. The rendered result is identical either way.
 *
 * Add a subset here for any non-Latin script the product needs — `cyrillic`, `greek`,
 * `vietnamese`. Without it those letters fall back to whatever the system has, mid-word.
